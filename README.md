# Grade Point Average (GPA) Calculator

This repository contains a simple Java program for calculating Grade Point Average (GPA). The program allows users to dynamically input their course name, course code, course unit, and scores. Subsequently, the program calculates the GPA, displays the result on the console, and presents the entered courses and values in a tabular form.

The code was developed as part of my assessment for the FirstBank Tech Academy 2.0 Program.

## Code Structure Overview

This program follows an Object-Oriented Approach, organized in different files.

### Files

- CourseModel.java: Defines the CourseModel class representing a course with its attributes.
- GPA.java: Contains the GPA class, which manages the GPA calculation and result display.
- App.javas: The main entry point for the program, allowing users to input course details.

### Formular used:

`Quality point = course unit * grade unit`
`GPA = total quality point / total grade unit`
